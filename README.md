# Fashion Item Classifier - CNN
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains 10 classes of clothing and accessory items. The goal of the project is to build a deep learning model capable of accurately predicting the category of each item based on its image.
